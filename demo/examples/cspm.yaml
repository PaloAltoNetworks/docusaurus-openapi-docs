    Access Keys are a secure way to enable programmatic access to the Prisma
    Cloud API. By default, only

    the System Admin has API access and can enable API access for other
    administrators. If you have API access,

    you can create up to two access keys. Create an access key for a limited
    time period and regenerate your API

    keys periodically to minimize exposure and follow security best practices.

        You can request usage data in one of the following formats;

        * Receive paginated usage data in the response object

        * Download usage data in a CSV file



        By default, you will receive your paginated usage data in the response
        object. You can control the number of items in the

        response object through the **limit** request body parameter. If data
        beyond what's in the response object is available,

        the response object attribute **nextPageToken** will provide a token you
        can set in the request parameter **pageToken** of your

        next request to get the next page of usage data.



        To download the usage data in a CSV file, set the following:

        * Request header: **Accept: application/octet-stream**

        * Request body parameter: **csvHeaderRequired** = **true**.



        The following example curl command requests usage data in a CSV file:


        ```bash

        curl --location --request POST
        'https://api.prismacloud.io/license/api/v1/usage' \

        --header 'x-redlock-auth:<your JWT>' \

To generate a token, you must have an access key and include the following values in the request body parameter — access key ID as the username and your secret key as the password. Prisma Cloud requires this JWT in the request header to authorize API access. Note that access keys maintain the same level of permissions as the permission group of the account that created them.   \r\n\r\nIf you are a multi-tenant user and the body parameters of your login call include a user name and password instead of an access key ID and secret key, then you will also need to provide the **prismaId** or the **customerName**.\nSpecifying just the **prismaId** is preferred, but specifying **customerName** is an acceptable alternative. Your **prismaId** is available from the \nlicense information in the Prisma Cloud console. It's unnecessary to specify both **prismaId** and **customerName**, but if you do specify both, the parameters must indicate the same tenant. \n\nNote that you should specify not only the URL and required headers, but also the request body or payload in any **POST /login** request.\nSee [Use Curl to Generate JWT Tokens in Prisma Cloud](https://prisma.pan.dev/docs/cloud/cspm/cspm-gs#use-curl-to-generate-jwt-tokens-in-prisma-cloud) for a detailed example.\n"

If you don't specify a value for **enabled** when you add a policy, the default is **enabled**=**true**\n* A rule, which identifies a saved search that defines the policy constraints (i.e. RQL query)\n* Optional compliance standards\n* Optional remediation details\n\nThe following are some examples of request body parameters for a request to add a policy. A new custom policy requires a saved search.\nSpecify a saved search ID for the **criteria** request parameter. You can request a list of exiting saved searches through the endpoint to \n[View Search History](/api/cloud/cspm/search-manager#operation/search-history).\n\nNote that the request parameters to add a custom config policy require a **cloudType**. The requests for other policy types default to a **cloudType** of **ALL**.\n\nThe JSON below is an example of the minimal request body parameters you need to add a config policy: \n```json\n{\n  \"cloudType\": \"aws\",\n  \"name\": \"Config test policy\",\n  \"policyType\": \"config\",\n  \"rule\": {\n    \"criteria\": \"e1234567-2798-4d1d-a1b0-52d60d49730b\",\n    \"name\": \"test rule\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"savedSearch\": \"true\"\n    },\n    \"type\": \"Config\"\n  },\n \"severity\": \"low\"\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON below is an example of the minimal request body parameters you need to add a network policy:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"test-network-policy\",\n  \"policyType\": \"network\",\n  \"severity\": \"medium\",\n  \"rule\": {\n    \"name\": \"test-network-rule\",\n    \"criteria\": \"c1234567-3a02-4392-a228-327d0db3324d\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"savedSearch\": \"true\"\n    },\n    \"type\": \"Network\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON below is an example of the minimal request body parameters you need to add an audit event policy:\n```json\n{\n  \"name\":\"test-event-policy\",\n  \"policyType\":\"audit_event\",\n  \"rule\":\n    {\"criteria\":\"91234567-087a-4318-a9b3-efe6041b87b1\",\n     \"name\":\"test-rule1\",\n     \"parameters\":{\n       \"savedSearch\":\"true\"\n     },\n     \"type\":\"AuditEvent\"\n    },\n  \"severity\":\"low\"\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON below is an example of the minimal request body parameters you need to add an IAM policy:\n```json\n{\n  \"cloudType\": \"ALL\",\n  \"name\": \"test-iam-policy\",\n  \"policyType\": \"IAM\",\n  \"rule\": {\n    \"criteria\": \"71234567-7251-4d3b-9be1-cced127fd09d\",\n    \"name\": \"test-iam\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"savedSearch\": \"true\"\n    },\n    \"type\": \"IAM\"\n },\n \"severity\": \"medium\"\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON below is an example of the minimal request body parameters you need to add a config policy that includes a compliance standard:\n```json\n{\n    \"cloudType\": \"aws\",\n    \"complianceMetadata\": [\n        {\n            \"standardName\": \"GDPR\",\n            \"requirementId\": \"Chapter 1\",\n            \"sectionId\": \"Article 1\",\n            \"customAssigned\": true,\n            \"complianceId\": \"91234567-7ddf-4e44-96fd-95135d9fbc6b\",\n            \"requirementName\": \"General provisions\",\n            \"sectionLabel\": \"Article 1\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"description\": \"API test\",\n    \"name\": \"demo\",\n    \"policyType\": \"config\",\n    \"rule\": {\n        \"criteria\": \"b1234567-84fc-4443-8cbc-f08f13fba586\",\n        \"name\": \"demo\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"savedSearch\": \"true\"\n        },\n        \"type\": \"Config\"\n    },\n    \"severity\": \"medium\"\n}        \n```\n"

        If you set the **Accept** request header to **appliation/json**, the
        response object contains an array of items with permissions data.


        The request parameter **limit** determines the number of items&mdash;for
        example, permissions&mdash;in the response object. If the amount of
        available data is greater than the specified **limit**, use the response
        object attribute **data.nextPageToken** as the request parameter
        **pageToken** in [Get Permissions Next
        Page](/api/cloud/cspm/iam#operation/get-next-permissions-page-with-post)
        to request the next page of data.


        If you set the **Accept** request header to **text/csv**, the response
        is a CSV that contains permissions details.

            You can apply a time filter by specifying a **timeType**. Only
            certain **timeUnit**,

            **startTime**, **endTime** query parameters apply to certain
            **timeType** values.

            The table below lists the time-related parameters that are

            both valid and required, for each **timeType** parameter.


            timeType  | Valid and Required Time Parameters
