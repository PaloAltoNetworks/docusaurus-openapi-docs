## Create a deployment status



Users with `push` access can create deployment statuses for a given deployment.

GitHub Apps require `read &amp; write` access to &quot;Deployments&quot; and `read-only` access to &quot;Repo contents&quot; (for private repos). OAuth Apps require the `repo_deployment` scope.
