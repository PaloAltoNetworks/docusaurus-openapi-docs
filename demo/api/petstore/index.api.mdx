## Introduction
This API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and is based on
[Petstore sample](http://petstore.swagger.io/) provided by [swagger.io](http://swagger.io) team.
It was **extended** to illustrate features of [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo)
tool and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) documentation. In addition to standard
OpenAPI syntax we use a few [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).

And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser.

## Authentication

Petstore offers two forms of authentication:
  - API Key

and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.
